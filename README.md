Welcome to my portfolio. This site will be build with React and will show off some of my projects. Learning web development has become a great passion in my life and I am excited to share some of my creations with you.

Building my personal site taught me a great deal. I learned how to set up hosting, how to use a FTP client, some cool CSS tricks, and also learned a bit about configuring a htaccess file to play nice with React-Router.
